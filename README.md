Permutation and Combination

order matters → permutation (Arranging 4 out of 8 people in a row for a photo: The order in which they are arranged matters (e.g., A, B, C, D is different from D, C, B, A). Use permutations.)
order doesn't matter → combination (Choosing 4 books out of 7 to take on a trip: The order in which the books are chosen doesn't matter (e.g., selecting A, B, C, D is the same as selecting D, C, B, A). Use combinations.)
